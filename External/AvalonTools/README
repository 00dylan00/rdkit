To build the optional Avalon Toolkit support, Avalon Toolkit sources are
needed. If Avalon Toolkit could not be found, the CMake build system will attempt to
download it from the following URL:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/avalontoolkit/files/AvalonToolkit_1.2/AvalonToolkit_1.2.0.source.tar

The default download URL and MD5 checksum can be overridden with the
following CMake definitions:

AVALONTOOLS_URL
AVALONTOOLS_MD5SUM

If AVALONTOOLS_URL is set to "", no download will be attempted.
If AVALONTOOLS_MD5SUM is set to "", no MD5 checksum will be performed.

If you prefer to install Avalon Toolkit sources manually, please download
a copy of the source from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/avalontoolkit/files/AvalonToolkit_1.2/AvalonToolkit_1.2.0.source.tar

Note that the version number is important.

Extract the tar file in $RDBASE/External/AvalonTools; the source required by the RDKit is in
the SourceDistribution directory.

cd to $RDBASE/External/AvalonTools and apply AvalonToolkit_1.2_patch.txt:

$ patch -p0 < AvalonToolkit_1.2_patch.txt
