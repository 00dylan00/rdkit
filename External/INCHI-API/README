To build InChI support, you have to download the official InChI software
distribution from the IUPAC website, and place the source code in this
directory. Please follow these instructions.

1. Download the zip file from
   http://www.iupac.org/inchi/download/version1.03/INCHI-1-API.zip

2. Unzip the package. 

3. In the unzipped folder, find INCHI-1-API/INCHI_API/inchi_dll, under which
   there are 73 files including things like ichi.h and ikey_dll.c. Copy all
   these 73 files to this directory that contains this README file.

Alternatively, if you are on a UNIX variant system (Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin,
etc), you may invoke the included script `download.sh`:
	
	$ bash download.sh
